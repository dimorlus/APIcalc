10.02.26 (2.09)
* Internal changes (comments translated to English), obsolet code removed.
* KB -> KiB changed in the Computing output format
+ KiB added to the Computing input format (KB also possible)
+ Added postfixes of order Q, R, q, r to engineering (scientific) formatb help file supplemented.
* The number reading code has been rewritten to be more understandable.
* Duplicate code formatting the result has been removed. Now, everything is handled by one function 
  (instead of two), and when making corrections or additions, you only need to change one function, 
  not two as before. The output itself has become more compact.
- The Force float option has been fixed, and the Auto option has been removed (it didn't do anything anyway).
+ Added the 75F format for temperature in Fahrenheit (and the frh(75) function converting Fahrenheit to Celsius). 
+ Temperature formatting has been added for output and input in Fahrenheit.
+ Added display of complex numbers in polar coordinates |modulus|(`degrees 'minutes 'seconds)
+ Now, for engineering and normalized representations of complex numbers, the modulus order is checked, and the 
  real and imaginary parts are normalized based on it.
