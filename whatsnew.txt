- Fixed a bug with recognizing 'i' or 'j' at the beginning of a name during implicit multiplication.

10.02.26 (2.09)
* Internal changes (comments translated to English), obsolet code removed.
* KB -> KiB changed in the Computing output format
* Duplicate code formatting the result has been removed. Now, everything is handled by one function 
  (instead of two), and when making corrections or additions, you only need to change one function, 
  not two as before. The output itself has become more compact.
* A BCB6 compilation option has been added to the calculator engine.  

08.02.26 (2.086)  
+ Added postfixes of order Q, R, q, r to engineering (scientific) formatb help file supplemented.
+ KiB added to the Computing input format (KB also possible)
* Transition to a simpler implementation of the output function.

07.02.26 (2.085)  
- The Force float option has been fixed, and the Auto option has been removed (it didn't do anything anyway).
+ cmplx, cpx added as synonim for cplx (cpx(1, 2)) function.
* SCF option removed CPX option added.
* The number reading code has been rewritten to be more understandable.

05.02.26 (2.082)  
+ Added display of complex numbers in polar coordinates |modulus|(`degrees 'minutes 'seconds)
+ Only relevant output formats are left for complex results.

26.01.26 (2.080)    
+ frh (frh(75)) fuction converting Fahrenheit to Celsius added.

+ Added gon and turns to the Degrees (angular) output format.
+ Date time input format :w (weeks) added.

30.12.25 (2.072)
* Optimization of the output formatting function.
+ Now, for engineering and normalized formats of complex numbers, the modulus order is checked, and the 
  real and imaginary parts are normalized based on it.

29.12.25 (2.069)
+ Added 1+i2 format for complex numbers in addition to 1+2i
- Added stack clearing before a new calculation to eliminate the influence of the previous one.
 
23.12.25 (2.067)
- Fixed a bug with an extra dot in a number.

22.12.25 (2.066)

15.12.25 (2.060)
+ wrgb, trgb, winf functions added.

14.12.25 (2.056)
- All predefined variables are now constants (trying to redefine them will result in an error).
